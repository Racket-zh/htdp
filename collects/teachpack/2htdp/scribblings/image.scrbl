@teachpack["image"]{Images}

@defmodule[#:require-form beginner-require 2htdp/image]

The image teachpack provides a number of basic image construction functions, along with
combinators for building more complex images out of existing images. Basic images include
various polygons, ellipses and circles, and text, as well as bitmaps (typically bitmaps 
come about via the @onscreen{Insert Image...} menu item in DrScheme.
Existing images can be rotated, scaled, and overlaid on top of each other.

@emph{This library is currently a work in progress. 
      I don't expect the existing primitives to change, but more will be added
      (and bugs will be fixed...).}

  the @scheme[weight] controls if it is boldface (or light), and @scheme[underline?]

@section{Equality Testing of Images}

Image equality testing is done structurally, i.e., based on 
the construction of the image, 
although with certain, expected equivalences. For example, 
two rectangles with the same width, height, color, and mode
are equal. Similarly, constructing a 20x10 rectangle and
then rotating it by 90 degress is equal to a 10x20 rectangle
(provided they have the same color and mode).

Equality testing may contain a few nuances, though:
@itemize[
  @item{Overlaying two images in opposite orders is never equal. For example,
        these two images are not @scheme[equal]:
        @schemeblock[(overlay/xy (rectangle 30 10 "solid" "blue")
                                 0
                                 10
                                 (rectangle 30 10 "solid" "red"))]
        @schemeblock[(overlay/xy (rectangle 30 10 "solid" "red")
                                 0
                                 -10
                                 (rectangle 30 10 "solid" "blue"))]
        even thought they may appear to be the same when drawn. 
        
        The rationale for them being different is that, at some scale factor,
        they will draw differently; specifically when they are scaled down
        far enough, the first will appear to be a single red pixel and the second will appear to
        be a single blue pixel.}
   @item{When rotating images, the internal calculations involve real numbers, not just
         rationals and thus must be approximated with Scheme's inexact numbers, causing
         small roundoff errors that make the images draw slightly differently. 
         
         To combat this problem, use @scheme[equal~?] to compare the images,
         or @scheme[check-within] for test suites involving images.}
   
   @item{Combining a series of line segments to form a polygon produces
         an image that is different than the polygon.}
   
   @item{In order to make equality on images created with 
         @scheme[text] and @scheme[text/font]
         work well, each string passed to either of those functions results
         in a number of horizontally aligned images, one for each letter in the
         string. This means that, for example
         @schemeblock[(equal? (beside/places "baseline"
                                             (text "a" 18 "black")
                                             (text "b" 18 "black"))
                              (text "ab" 18 "black"))]
         is true, but that subtle aspects of font drawing may be wrong, since
         the underlying toolkit only gets a single letter at a time, instead
         of the entire word (or sentence).
         
         The most obvious way that this shows up is in the handling of ligatures.
         For example, the letter combinations ``ff'' and ``fi'' and ``fl'' are
         generally drawn intertwined when they appear together, and thus an ``f''
         drawn separately from an ``i'' looks different than the ligature ``fi''.
         For example, here is how 24 point Times font looks when the word ``refill''
         is drawn, first with ligatures and then without:
         @centerline{@image["2htdp/scribblings/ligature.png"]}.
         }
